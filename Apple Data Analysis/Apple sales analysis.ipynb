The popularity of 4GB RAM models (by volume of ratings) contrasts slightly with the peak satisfaction levels seen with classic Black and White colors and, significantly, within the ₹20k-₹50k price band.\n","\n","This suggests that customers in this dataset show high satisfaction with iPhones that offer perceived value (potentially older models or specific deals falling into that price range) and prefer traditional color options.
